# 796. Rotate String

## Difficulty
**Easy**

---

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if and only if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts on `s`.

A shift on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.

### Example

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Notes
This problem is commonly asked in coding interviews and tests your understanding of string manipulation and rotation logic.
