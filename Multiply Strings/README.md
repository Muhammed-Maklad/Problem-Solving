# 43. Multiply Strings

## Difficulty
**Medium**

---

## Problem Description

Given two non-negative integers represented as strings `num1` and `num2`, return the product of these two numbers as a string.

**Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integers directly.

### Example

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
```
**Output:**
```
"6"
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
```
**Output:**
```
"56088"
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
- Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Notes
This problem tests your understanding of string manipulation and the implementation of multiplication algorithms without using built-in numeric conversion. It's a common interview question that evaluates your ability to handle large numbers beyond standard data type limits.
