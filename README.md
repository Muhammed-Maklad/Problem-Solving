### For Learning

1. **Choose a Topic** - Start with a category you want to improve (Strings, Arrays, SQL)
2. **Select Difficulty** - Begin with Easy problems and progress to Medium/Hard
3. **Read the Problem** - Each folder contains a README.md with the full problem statement
4. **Attempt Yourself** - Try solving before viewing the solution
5. **Review Solution** - Study the approach, complexity analysis, and implementation
6. **Practice Variations** - Look for similar problems to reinforce learning


### Example Usage

```bash
# Navigate to a specific problem
cd "Median of Two Sorted Arrays"

# View the problem statement and solution
cat README.md

# Run the solution (example for Python)
python solution.py
```
